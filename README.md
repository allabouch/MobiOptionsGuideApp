## About Me 🔴🔴🔴 ##

رسالة من القلب إليك، صديقي العزيز: لا تظن أنني خبير أو مبرمج محترف، فأنا مجرد شخص حاول جاهدًا تعلم ما يمكنه أن يفعله في هذا المجال. لقد ضربت يدي بقوة على الأساس، وتجاوزت حدود معرفتي لأصل إلى هذا الكود. أحمله إليك الآن، ليس كهدية من محترف، ولكن كعربون صداقة ودعم من شخص يسعى لتسهيل طريقك ومساعدتك على الانضمام إلى هذا العالم الرائع. أتمنى لك كل التوفيق والنجاح، وأعلم أنني هنا دائمًا لأساعدك وأقف بجانبك.
A heartfelt message from me to you, my dear friend: Don't think of me as an expert or a seasoned programmer. I'm just someone who has struggled mightily to learn what I could in this field. I've pounded my hands on the foundation, stretched beyond my knowledge, to arrive at this code. I bring it to you now, not as a gift from a professional, but as a token of friendship and support from someone striving to make your path easier and help you join this wonderful world. I wish you all the success and prosperity, and know that I'm always here to assist you and stand by your side.
